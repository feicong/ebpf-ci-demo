Subject: [PATCH 04/15] arm64: kgdb_step_brk_fn: ignore other's exception

ARM64 step exception does not have any syndrome information. So, it is
responsibility of exception handler to take care that they handle it
only if exception was raised for them.

Since kgdb_step_brk_fn() always returns 0, therefore we might have problem
when we will have other step handler registered as well.

This patch fixes kgdb_step_brk_fn() to return error in case of step handler
was not meant for kgdb.
