Subject: [PATCH 12/14] Disable PAN and UAO for Pixel3a

Currently bpf programs on Pixel3a can't access user-land strings. The issue was
brought up before by Joel Fernandes and Will Deacon explained relevant arm64
capabilities here: https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1069552/#1267047.

As a mitigation I am disabling both UAO and PAN. The kernel is intended for
insepction of trusted applications so that should be fine.
